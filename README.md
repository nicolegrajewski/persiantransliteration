# Persian Transliteration
Corpus for the Transliteration of Persian Sources (LoC). 

## How to use 
Files with Persian words in Arabic script and transliterated forms can be found in [Data](https://github.com/nicolegrajewski/persiantransliteration/tree/data). At present, the most efficient way to use the data is by adapting the [Arabic Transliterator](https://github.com/MTG/ArabicTransliterator) code.

## Dependencies 
Most of the dependencies are already included in the the [Arabic Transliterator](https://github.com/MTG/ArabicTransliterator) code. The only additional dependency needed to properly display Arabic characters is:

[python-bidi](https://pypi.org/project/python-bidi/)
