# Persian Transliteration
Corpus for the Transliteration of Persian Sources (LoC). 

## How to use 
Files include Persian words in their Arabic script and transliterated forms. At present, the most efficient way to use the data is by adapting the [Arabic Transliterator](https://github.com/MTG/ArabicTransliterator) code.

## Dependencies 
Most of the dependencies are already included in the the [Arabic Transliterator](https://github.com/MTG/ArabicTransliterator) code. The only additional dependency needed to properly display Arabic characters is:
